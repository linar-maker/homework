Big up to my brother
Blessed sons and daughters
We all lookin' for the answers
We in search of living water
Too blind to see the Messiah
Are you weary? Are you tired?
Runnin' on empty, feelin' the fire
Mm, the Devil is a liar
The story's already written
Children, you are forgiven (Yeah)
Ain't nothin' you could do for you to change that
And everythin' you did, He erased that
Yeah, He took it all and threw it in the wasteland

Freedom, don't it feel good? (Mm)
Freedom, don't it feel good?
Freedom, don't it feel good? (Mm)
Freedom, don't it feel good? (Bah)
